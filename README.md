# Pokemon2D

This was a small project I made with JavaFX and CSS. It first makes the user pick a few Pokemon out of hundreds of choices with a UI, then has them battle it out against a few teams.
It combines music, visuals, some animations, and purely user input in a GUI to create an interesting experience.
